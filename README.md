# EcmaScript 2016+ The Boring Part

Setup for all modern JS web apps. It's not going to force you to use any specyfic toolset/framework. Be free and make **your** choice. *EcmaScript 2016+ The Boring Part* is just a setup which allows you to develop and deploy app without pain. It's not a bare minimum, although I tried to keep things simple.
